cases by playoffs sport is generally recognised as system of activities based in physical athleticism or physical dexterity with major competitions such as the olympic games admitting only sports meeting this definition other organisations such as the council of europe preclude activities without a physical element from classification as sports however a number of competitive but activities

recognises five sports bridge chess draughts checkers go and xiangqi and limits the number of mind games which can be admitted as sports sport is usually governed by a set of rules or customs which serve to ensure fair competition and allow consistent adjudication of the winner winning can be determined by physical events such as scoring goals or crossing a line first it can also be determined by judges who are scoring elements of the sporting performance including objective or subjective measures such as technical performance or artistic impression records of performance are often kept and

purpose of gambling hunting and games and diversions including ones that require exercise roget defines the noun sport as an activity engaged in for relaxation and amusement with synonyms including diversion and recreation the singular term sport is used in most english dialects to describe the overall concept children taking part in sport with sports used to describe multiple activities football and rugby are the most popular sports in england american english uses sports for both terms the precise definition of what differentiates a sport from other leisure activities varies between sources the closest to an international agreement on a definition is provided by the global association of international sports federations gaisf which is the association for all the largest international sports federations including association football athletics cycling tennis equestrian sports and more and is therefore the de facto representative of international sport gaisf uses the following criteria determining that a sport should they also recognise that sport can be primarily physical such as rugby or athletics primarily mind such as chess or go predominantly motorised such as formula 1 or powerboating primarily such as snooker and other cue sports or primarily such as equestrian sport the inclusion of mind sports within sport definitions has not been universally accepted leading to legal challenges from governing bodies in regards to being denied funding available to sports whilst gaisf recognises a small number of mind sports it is not open to admitting any further mind sports there has been an increase in the application of the term sport to a wider set of challenges such as video games also called esports from electronic sports especially due to the large scale of participation and organised competition but these are not widely recognised by mainstream sports organisations according to council of europe european sports charter article means all forms of physical activity which through casual or organised participation aim at expressing or improving physical fitness and mental forming social relationships or obtaining results in competition at all levels there are opposing views on the necessity of competition as a defining element of a sport with almost all professional sports involving competition and governing bodies requiring competition as a prerequisite of recognition by the international olympic committee ioc or gaisf other bodies advocate widening the definition of sport to include all physical activity for instance the council of europe include all forms of physical exercise including those competed just for fun in order to widen participation and reduce the impact of losing on less able participants there has been an introduction of physical activity to traditionally competitive events such as school sports days although moves like this are often controversial in competitive events participants are graded or classified based on their result and often divided into groups of comparable performance gender weight and age the measurement of the result may be objective or subjective and corrected with handicaps or penalties in a race for example the time to complete the course is an objective measurement in gymnastics or diving the result is decided by a panel of judges and therefore subjective

such a high walls mental ability overcoming challenges and fears by personal courage and determination often military assault courses will be standardised and will have for example in the uk a and a wall a climbing net some type of bar to climb over and a high rope or net that must be crossed these being or representing the most likely difficult terrain that a soldier will come across the standardisation means that every course will be to the same quality though it also means that there will be certain parts that may be familiar if practised however they have different purposes for example they can be short less than a minute with a rifle range on the end junior leaders folkestone or long five minutes as at thetford this is partially because of space restraints and training objectives the short one can be run as an individual course and a warmup for the range the long thetford course is more of an exercise in endurance and teamwork individual obstacles can be for general fitness of for quite specific task such as cargo nets which simulates soldiers climbing down nets from ships into landing craft for beachhead landings climbing through windows is a useful skill when

through walls to climb over beams walls or planks to balance on steps to climb up walls with window size holes to climb through and mazes to negotiate overhead traverse monkey bars are popular whilst the primary role of a military assault course is to improve fitness they are also used for the assessment of personnel to see if they are suitable for a specific role for example in the british military potential paratroopers have to complete the british army s parachute regiment s trainasium as one of the test to be allowed to progress to parachute training and the royal marine s bottom

10,education is the transmission of knowledge skills and character traits and comes in many forms formal education happens in a complex institutional framework like public schools education is also structured but takes place outside the formal schooling system while informal education is unstructured learning through daily experiences formal and education are divided into levels that include early childhood education primary education secondary education and tertiary education other classifications focus on the teaching method like and education and on the subject like science education language education and physical education the term education can also refer to the mental states and qualities of educated people and the academic field studying educational phenomena the precise definition of education is disputed and there are disagreements about what the aims of education are and to what extent education is different from indoctrination by fostering critical thinking these disagreements affect how to identify measure and improve forms of education fundamentally education socializes children into society by teaching cultural values and norms it equips them with the skills needed to become productive members of society this way it stimulates economic growth and raises awareness of local and global problems organized institutions affect many aspects of education for example governments set education policies to determine when school classes happen what is taught and who can or must attend international organizations like unesco have been influential in promoting primary education for all children many factors influence whether education is successful psychological factors include motivation intelligence and personality social factors like socioeconomic status ethnicity and gender are often linked to discrimination further factors include access to educational technology teacher quality and parent involvement the main academic field investigating education is called education studies it examines what education is what aims and effects it has and how to improve it education studies has many subfields like philosophy psychology sociology and economics of education it also discusses comparative education pedagogy and the history of education in prehistory education happened informally through oral communication and imitation with the rise of ancient civilizations writing was invented and the amount of knowledge grew this caused a shift from informal to formal education initially formal education was mainly available to elites and religious groups the invention of the printing press in the 15th century made books more widely available this increased general literacy beginning in the 18th and 19th centuries public education became more important this development led to the worldwide process of making primary education available to all free of charge and compulsory up to a certain age today over 90 of all children worldwide attend primary school the term education is derived from the latin words educare meaning to bring up and educere meaning to bring forth the definition of education has been explored by theorists from various fields many agree that education is a purposeful activity aimed at achieving goals like the transmission of knowledge skills and character traits extensive debate surrounds its exact nature beyond these general features one approach views education as a process that occurs during events such as schooling teaching and learning another outlook understands education not as a process but as the mental states and dispositions of educated persons that result from this process additionally the term may also refer to the academic field that studies the methods processes and social institutions involved in teaching and learning having a clear idea of what the term means matters when trying to identify educational phenomena measure educational success and improve educational practices some theorists provide precise definitions by identifying the specific features that are exclusive to all forms of education education theorist peters for instance outlines three essential features of education which include that knowledge and understanding are imparted to the student and that this process is beneficial and done in a morally appropriate manner such precise definitions often succeed at characterizing the most typical forms of education however they often face criticism because less common types of education occasionally fall outside their parameters the difficulty of dealing with counterexamples not covered by precise definitions can be avoided by offering less exact definitions based on family resemblance instead this means that all the forms of education are similar to each other but they need not share a set of essential features that all of them have in common some education theorists such as keira sewell and stephen newman hold that the term education is evaluative or thick conceptions of education state that it is part of the nature of education to lead to some kind of improvement they contrast with thin conceptions which provide a explanation some theorists provide a descriptive conception of education by observing how the term is commonly used in ordinary language prescriptive conceptions by contrast define what good education is or how education should be practiced many thick and prescriptive conceptions see education as an activity that tries to achieve certain aims which may range from acquiring knowledge and learning to think rationally to nurturing character traits like kindness and honesty various scholars stress the role of critical thinking to distinguish education from indoctrination they state that mere indoctrination is only interested in instilling beliefs in the student independent of whether the beliefs are rational whereas education also fosters the rational ability to critically reflect on and question those beliefs it is not universally accepted that these two phenomena can be clearly distinguished since some forms of indoctrination may be necessary in the early stages of education while the child mind is not yet sufficiently developed this applies to cases in which young children need to learn something without being able to understand the underlying reasons like certain safety rules and hygiene practices education can be characterized from the teacher or the student perspective definitions focus on the perspective and role of the teacher in the transmission of knowledge and skills in a morally appropriate way definitions analyze education from the student involvement in the learning process and hold that this process transforms and enriches their,Education
11,antipedagogy german antipädagogik ancient greek boy lead uk sometimes spelled with the hyphen is a critical theory that examines traditional pedagogical dynamics particularly scrutinizing the exercise of parental or educational authority as a violation of human rights the enlightenment brings attention to the detrimental effects of conventional pedagogy and advocates for intergenerational equality in 1975 ekkehard von braunmühl laid the foundation for this theory with his publication antipedagogy studies on the abolition of education the term antipedagogy denotes an approach or opposition to specific principles and methods of traditional education and pedagogy this perspective scrutinizes the structure of the educational system teaching and learning methods and the role of authority in education generally antipedagogy includes elements like challenging hierarchical authority emphasizing individualized learning subverting traditional structures employing alternative teaching methods and resisting the standardization of education it is essential to recognize that this is a broad definition and the antipedagogical approach exhibits variations among practitioners and theorists within the movement for some scholars antipedagogy may manifest as a departure from traditional education while for others it could entail a more radical opposition to the established structures and principles different views on traditional pedagogy and education including objective criticism and nihilistic attitudes reject the necessity of human education and pedagogy as a unique theoretical science traditional education is perceived as a repressive endeavor that neglects the child freedom dignity and rights hindering the expression of their true self advocates of antipedagogism are dedicated to fostering children freedom promoting harmony between their activities and emotions encouraging externalization and internalization and advocating for the deschooling of society the roots of antipedagogism can be traced back to the early 17th century when the related word began to carry a negative connotation of pedantry dating back to at least the 1650s during that period it became associated with the english parliamentarian samuel pepys who expressed a negative attitude towards and evaluated the terms and unfavorably the development of antipedagogical perspectives has also been influenced and contributed to by representatives of the theory of school abolition such as ivan illich john holt everett reimer neil postman viktor shulgin etc genuine antipedagogism emerged in the late 1960s and 70s linked to the american psychologist carl rogers and the american children rights movement led by george miller farson and holt the term antipedagogy was coined by kupffer in 1974 with theoretical foundations established by ekkehard von braunmühl in his book antipädagogik 1975 precursors include maria montessori neill th gordon célestin freinet ovide decroly and janusz korczak it gained prominence in germany with representatives such as von braunmühl von schoenebeck ostermeyer hinte and rochefort antipedagogy in various forms is particularly widespread especially in european countries heinrich kupffer 1974 essay antipsychiatrie und antipädagogik was among the early works introducing the term heinrich kupffer a social pedagogy lecturer at the university of education in kiel extended his criticism from psychiatry to pedagogy in 1970 von braunmühl and others in wiesbaden founded the 1st antipedagogical club kinderhaus v 1st apc kinderhaus attempting to put the antipedagogical movement into practice ekkehard von braunmühl book antipedagogic studies on the abolition of education published in 1975 further solidified the foundations of antipedagogy according to von braunmühl education and pedagogy are not only unnecessary but also unfavorable for children people and life he views parenting as an act of contempt subjugation and injustice against children refusing to issue orders or prohibitions von braunmühl critiques the attitude inexorably linked to the alleged for guidance in children arguing that education is a designation exclusively for planned intentional actions aimed at the child as an object he highlights the misconception of equating parenting with learning emphasizing the distinction between activities by adults against children and activities by children themselves,Education

14,definitions of education aim to describe the essential features of education a great variety of definitions has been proposed there is wide agreement that education involves among other things the transmission of knowledge but there are deep disagreements about its exact nature and characteristics some definitions see education as a process exemplified in events like schooling teaching and learning others understand it not as a process but as the product of such processes as what characterizes educated persons various attempts have been made to give precise definitions listing its necessary and sufficient conditions the failure of such attempts often in the form of being unable to account for various counter examples has led many theorists to adopt less precise conceptions based on family resemblance on this view different forms of education are similar by having overlapping features but there is no set of features shared by all forms clarity about the nature of education is central for various issues for example to coherently talk about the subject and to determine how to achieve and measure it an important discussion in the academic literature is about whether evaluative aspects are already part of the definition of education and if so what roles they play thin definitions are while thick definitions include evaluative and normative components for example by holding that education implies that the person educated has changed for the better descriptive conceptions try to capture how the term education is actually used by competent speakers prescriptive conceptions on the other hand stipulate what education should be like or what constitutes good education thick and prescriptive conceptions often characterize education in relation to the goals it aims to realize these goals are sometimes divided into epistemic goods like knowledge and understanding skills like rationality and critical thinking and character traits like kindness and honesty some theorists define education in relation to an overarching purpose like socialization or helping the learner lead a good life the more specific aims can then be understood as means to achieve this overarching purpose various researchers emphasize the role of critical thinking to distinguish education from indoctrination traditional accounts of education characterize it mainly from the teacher perspective usually by describing it as a process in which they transmit knowledge and skills to their students definitions on the other hand emphasize the student experience for example based on how education transforms and enriches their subsequent experience some conceptions take both the teacher and the student point of view into account by focusing on their shared experience of a common world definitions of education try to determine the essential features of education many general characteristics have been ascribed to education however there are several disagreements concerning its exact definition and a great variety of definitions have been proposed by theorists belonging to diverse fields there is wide agreement that education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims in this sense education involves the transmission of knowledge but it is often pointed out that this factor alone is not sufficient and needs to be accompanied by other factors such as the acquisition of practical skills or instilling moral character traits many definitions see education as a task or a process in this regard the conception of education is based on what happens during events like schooling training instructing teaching and learning this process may in turn be understood either from the perspective of the teacher or with a focus on the student experience instead however other theorists focus mainly on education as an achievement a state or a product that results as a consequence of the process of being educated such approaches are usually based on the features mental states and character traits exemplified by educated persons in this regard being educated implies having an encompassing familiarity with various topics so one does not become an educated person just by undergoing specialized training in one specific field besides these two meanings the term education may also refer to the academic field studying the methods and processes involved in teaching and learning or to social institutions employing these processes education is usually understood as a very general term that has a wide family of diverse instances nonetheless some attempts have been made to give a precise definition of the essential features shared by all forms of education an influential early attempt was made by peters in his book ethics and education where he suggests three criteria that constitute the necessary and sufficient conditions of education 1 it is concerned with the transmission of knowledge and understanding 2 this transmission is worthwhile and 3 done in a morally appropriate manner in tune with the student interests this definition has received a lot of criticism in the academic literature while there is wide agreement that many forms of education fall under these three criteria opponents have rejected that they are true for all of them by providing various counterexamples for example in regard to the third criterion it may be sometimes necessary to educate children about certain facts even though they are not interested in learning about these facts and regarding the second criterion not everyone agrees that education is always desirable because of the various difficulties and counterexamples with this and other precise definitions some theorists have argued that there is no one true definition of education in this regard the different forms of education may be seen as a group of loosely connected topics and different groups within a society may have differing legitimate conceptions of education some theorists have responded to this by defining education in terms of family resemblance this is to say that there is no one precise set of features shared by all and only by forms of education instead there is a group of many features characteristic of education some of these features apply to one form of education while slightly different ones are exemplified by another form of education in this sense any two forms of education are similar and their,Education

found that dispositional empathy with nature den robustly predicted both public supporting an environmental organization and private household behaviors such as recycling conservation behavior ienna and colleagues in their study of 878 participants found that both empathy and knowledge of environmental issues predicted attitudes and behavior though verifiable knowledge was a stronger predictor the authors also found a dissociation between cognitive and affective affective empathy was found to predict attitudes but not behavior cognitive empathy predicted both this finding aligned with the authors prediction that cognitive empathy would influence behavior in a similar way as knowledge wang and colleagues found that inducing empathy for nature through photographs and videos led to increased behaviors for individuals with independent interdependent however higher empathy with nature did not lead to such behaviors the study found that empathy towards nature led participants to make a commitment to the environment a mediating factor which in turn prompted increased environmental behavior based on daniel batson s model of altruism jaime berenguer designed a study to test the effects of empathy on moral reasoning participants who were prompted to practice empathy when reading a passage about an environmental dilemma were able to construct significantly more moral arguments

16,generation z or gen z for short colloquially also known as zoomers is the demographic cohort succeeding millennials and preceding generation alpha researchers and popular media use the 1990s as starting birth years and the early 2010s as ending birth years this article focuses specifically on the education of generation z across the globe gen z has generally high enrollment in primary schools in both developed and developing countries the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd has supported research on educational spending and achievement in its 36 member states and found that while spending increased in the early 2000s academic performance has largely stagnated students from china and singapore both outside of the oecd continued to outperform their peers the oecd attributes socioeconomic background as a key factor in academic success however some countries demonstrate a weak link between background and performance meaning these countries have the most equitable education systems the pandemic has disrupted the education of around one and a half billion students as schools in 165 countries closed their doors and 60 million teachers were sent home according to unesco schools were partially or fully closed for nearly 80 of instruction time during the first year of the pandemic some countries expanded access to the internet in remote areas or broadcast more educational materials on national television this was an option in all contexts as internet access varied significantly and about of people under the age of 25 around the world did have access to the internet at home in the early 2000s the number of students from emerging economies going abroad for higher education rose significantly this was a golden age of growth for many western universities admitting international students however ended this golden age this article expands on the education of gen z including global trends and additional information for asia europe north america and oceania enrollment in primary schools in developing countries has been rising steadily since the century by the 1990s and 2000s enrollment rates in these countries approached 100 sitting just below those of the developed world according to the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd countries spent an average of us educating their children from primary school to university in 2014 over students between the ages of eight and nine from 49 countries and territories took part in the 2015 trends in international mathematics and science study timss the students in mathematics hailed from singapore hong kong south korea taiwan and japan in particular the gap between the lowest scoring east asian country japan at 593 was 23 points higher than the next nation northern ireland at 570 which was unchanged from 2011 in science the top scorers were from singapore south korea japan russia and hong kong the program for international student assessment pisa is administered every three years to schoolchildren around the world on reading comprehension mathematics and science students from 71 nations and territories took the pisa tests in 2015 students with the highest average scores in mathematics came from singapore hong kong macao taiwan and japan in science from singapore japan estonia taiwan and finland and in reading from singapore hong kong canada finland and ireland in 2019 the oecd surveyed educational standards and achievement of its 36 member states and found that while education spending has gone up by an average of 15 over the previous decade the academic performance of students in reading mathematics and science on the pisa has largely stagnated students from china and singapore both outside of the oecd continued to outclass their global peers among all the countries that sent their students to take the pisa only albania colombia macao moldova peru portugal and qatar saw any improvements since joining of these only portugal is an oecd country meanwhile australia finland iceland the netherlands new zealand slovakia and south korea all saw a decline in overall performance since joining funding while important is not necessarily the most important thing as the case of estonia demonstrates estonia spent 30 below the oecd average yet still achieved top marks the socioeconomic background is a key factor in academic success in the oecd with students coming from families in the top 10 of the income distribution being three years ahead in reading skills compared to those from the bottom 10 however the link between background and performance was weakest in australia canada denmark estonia finland japan norway south korea and the united kingdom meaning these countries have the most equitable education systems a proposed method of assessing the equality of educational opportunities in a given society is to measure the heritability of academic ability as empirical evidence does support the hypothesis that the heritability of test results is higher in a country with a national curriculum compared to one with a decentralized system having a national curriculum aimed at equality reduces environmental influences different nations and territories approach the question of how to nurture gifted students differently during the 2000s and 2010s whereas the middle east and east asia especially china hong kong and south korea and singapore actively sought them out and steered them towards top programs europe and the united states had in mind the goal of inclusion and chose to focus on helping struggling students in 2010 for example china unveiled a national talent development plan to identify able students and guide them into stem fields and careers in high demand that same year england dismantled its national academy for gifted and talented youth and redirected the funds to help students get admitted to elite universities developmental cognitive psychologist david geary observed

18,exformation originally spelled eksformation in danish is a term originally coined by danish science writer tor nørretranders in his book the user illusion published in english 1998 it is meant to mean explicitly discarded information in 2017 the concept was redefined by kenya hara 原 研哉 hara born 1958 a japanese graphic designer who teaches communication design and design theory at the design faculty of musashino art university 武蔵野美術大学 musashino bijutsu daigaku in tokyo hara first proposed the concept to his students postulating the of a novel method of communication through design a communication method by making things unknown in 2020 exformation was again reformulated by the belgian educationist and learner experience designer francis laleman who positioned the concept as exformative learning a particular type of cooperative learning based on collectivized intuition systemic exploration and making things unknown effective communication depends on a shared body of knowledge between the persons communicating in using words sounds and gestures the speaker has deliberately thrown away a huge body of information though it remains implied this shared context is called exformation exformation is everything we do not actually say but have in our heads when or before we say anything at all whereas information is the measurable demonstrable utterance we actually come out with if someone is talking about computers what is said will have more meaning if the person listening has some prior idea what a computer is what it is good for and in what contexts one might encounter one from the information content of a message alone there is no way of measuring how much exformation it contains examples consider the following phrase the best horse at the race is number 7 the information carried is very small if considered from the point of view of information theory just a few words however if this phrase was spoken by a knowledgeable person after a complex study of all the horses in the race to someone interested in betting the details are discarded but the receiver of the information might get the same practical value of a complete analysis in 1862 the author victor hugo wrote to his publisher asking how his most recent book les misérables was getting on hugo just wrote in his message to which his publisher replied to indicate it was selling well this exchange of messages would have no meaning to a third party because the shared context is unique to those taking part in it the amount of information a single character was extremely small and yet because of exformation a meaning is clearly conveyed thought argues nørretranders is in fact a process of chucking away information and it is this detritus happily labeled exformation that is crucially involved in automatic behaviours of expertise riding a bicycle playing the piano and which is therefore the most precious to us as people intimately related to nørretranders concept of exformation is subtext any content of a creative work which is not announced explicitly by characters or author but is implicit or intuitively understood by the audience while subtext exists hidden beneath and can be missed in conversational processes because it is internal to the speaker or writer exformation is hidden alongside subtext is understood to require social skills such as empathy and active listening to figure out in contrast exformation requires systemic skills such as interbeing and associations the japanese designer and design teacher kenya hara started exploring the concept of in designing design before submitting the idea as a project to his students in contrast to information exformation describes how little we really know and thus becomes the starting point for any type of design in 2015 kenya hara collects what exformation can look like in design practice and how this concept alters our classic understanding of information design following the path embarked on in designing design continues to explore the void absence and indeterminacy in contemporary design each year roughly a dozen students come together at the prestigious musashino art university joining hara in an attempt to make things unknown presents their collective efforts resulting in a book of incredibly beautiful humorous and design and writing in 2020 the belgian educationist francis laleman brought exformation to the education and systemic design fields where it replaces the and instructional banking model of education and its focus on learning for the status quo paolo freire 1970 with an design model directed at and the exploration of possibilities as yet hidden in the unknown laleman 2020 exformative design then is a discipline explicitly driven by the love for exploring the unknowns in the context of boundless systemic interaction and exformative action is immersion into the system and realizing an adaptive self at the inside of it in laleman work exformation is both a design practice and a facilitation method as a design practice it replaces classic instructional design exformative design is design it implies transformation of the already known into the possibilities enshrined in the as yet unknown in practice this means that the student learning objectives are either absent or formulated during the process by means of participatory design learning needs formerly identified through training needs analysis or tna are recognized as temporary artifacts and replaced by a sequence of and or user stories at best learning is offered to learning groups cooperative learning with members as diverse and intergenerational as possible in short iterations each followed by a learning review and a retrospective learners act on invitation and voluntary participation which leads to a high level of meaningful engagement exformative learning design has no learning agenda expressed as nagenda instead a dynamic learning backlog is concept taken from the scrum framework for software development in brief exformative learning design is based on incremental iterations of structural activities from which at the end of each iteration learning is extracted
